As we saw in the [prior](21_deployment_on_azure_container_instances.ipynb) deployment notebook, this can be done by deploying on Azure Container Instances.

The latter is typically better suited for web services with high traffic (i.e. &gt 100 requests per second) and high GPU utilization. There is a [wide variety](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes-general) of machine types that can be used. In the present example, however, we will not need the fastest machines that exist nor the most memory optimized ones. We will use typical default machines:\n",

    "- When configuring the provisioning of an AKS cluster, we need to choose a type of machine, as examplified above. This choice must be such that the number of virtual machines (also called `agent nodes`), we require, multiplied by the number of vCPUs on each machine must be greater than or equal to 12 vCPUs. This is indeed the [minimum needed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-deploy-and-where#create-a-new-aks-cluster) for such cluster. By default, a pool of 3 virtual machines gets provisioned on a new AKS cluster to allow for redundancy. So, if the type of virtual machine we choose has a number of vCPUs (`vm_size`) smaller than 4, we need to increase the number of machines (`agent_count`) such that `agent_count x vm_size` &ge; `12` virtual CPUs. `agent_count` and `vm_size` are both parameters we can pass to the `provisioning_configuration()` method below.\n",
